# Requirements

The project's main obsticles have been tackled and now there are only a handful of legitamate deliverables to finish up. 

### Burndown Graph
Burndown graph can be found [here](https://github.com/Eshop-project/CS-350/blob/master/docs/plan/Milestone_6/burn.pdf).

### Acceptance criteria
We have choosen to make the website targeted to sell unique shoes.  We have also choosen to use Paypal to handle our checkout
processing.  The checkout buttons all work on Paypal API. The view button now works by creating its own class.  Website is up and running 
we just need to test it.

### Project metrics (remaining work, test quality)
Remaining work would be to stlye website more than it is.  If we were going to go live it would need webhosting a ssl certificate for paypal to work and the dummy account
must be changed to real account.  Real inventory would have to be loaded but fully functional paypal store as is.

### Possible adjustment of Project Scope

From the original Requirements and idea of the web page, we have changed a huge amount of detail. From the previous one, we don't plan on anything being taken out, and we plan to finish everything listed above in the current requirements, and possibly have time to continue adding a handful of non-important details to the website before the semester finishes. The theme of the website has changed to shoes and styling might change as well if time permits.
