# Code - Core Features

### Fix all defects

At this point in the project we have been able to implement all the core featues of our Online Store application. These features were described in detail during Milestone #5 Design Role. The last feature that we had left to complete was the Paypal implementation. We were able to get this feature working and it is currently funtional at our website. Testing the paypal feature is rather a challenge since we don't want to be using actual money. We are working with paypal at the moment to develop a testing account so we can confirm that it is working correctly. All other features in our project have been tested and are fully functional. 

### Test-Driven Workflow

Test-Driven workflow has been a main priority for our team since the start of the project. We accredit a lot of our progress and success of our application to the test driven development workflow. The way TTD looks like for our team is a series of steps that are usually carried out by the person in the Code role and the Test role. The two members in these seats are usually working side by side, to ensure that we are writting tests for each main feature that we implement in the code. During milestone #6 we were able to implement the last feature of our application which was the Paypal Implementation that would allow a person to actually purchase items from our online store. We are currently working on creating a testing account with paypal so that we can test feature using sanbox account that uses "fake" money for testing purposes. 

### Implementation Cycle 

|Implementation Cycle| | |
|---|-----|-------------------|
|1|Test|Right after writting some code, write tests in the test.py file that will help us identify bugs in the newly written code|
|2|Fix|After executing the tests in the console using the "python manage.py test" command we can identify which test ran succesfully|
|3|Extend|We aim at extending our test by increasing the complexity of the old and current test that we have in our test.py file|
|4|Improve|Improve the quality of our tests so that we are able to identify new bugs that we may have missed during previous milestone|

### Log and Issue Tracking

Our team has done a good job so far at tracking issues using Github Issue tracking feature. We have been able to identify a total of 23 issues during the span of the project. From these 23 issues we have been able to close 17 of them, leaving only 5 issues left to be resolved. We are aiming at resolving these issues before the Demo Day of our application which is November 30th. We want to have a clean issue log so that we can take constructive fedback from our classmates and have enough time to implement the changes/issues that found during the demo.
