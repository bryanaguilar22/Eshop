# Requirements Design - Refactoring and Code Structure

### Implement all required features

Up to this Milestone we have implemented all of these major features that our E-commerce website is going to use. Our goal as a team was to tackle one major feature each milestone. Here is the break down of the features that we have completed and the corresponding milestone. 

|Features|Milestone #|
|---------------------|-----|
|Setting Up Development Tools|1|
|Host a Simple App at PythonAnywhere|2|
|Data Models and CRUD|3|
|Template and View Inheritance|4|
|User Registration and Authentication|5|
|Paypal Implementation |6|
|Bug clean up and Final Presentation |7|

The last main feature that we have yet to incorporate into our application is the PayPal implementation. Being able to handle transactions is at the core of what makes a E-Commerce website so we have been doing extensive reasearch in this area to make sure that we are approaching it in the right way. The last thing we want to do is have this feature working partially and face problems with missing payments or monetary transactions.

### Improve code structure

During this Milestone I spent a lot of time with the Code and Test role to go over each line of code to make sure that we are not leaving any random comments here and there and to clean up the structure of the application as a whole. The person in the requirments role also contributed in this area by moving all of our JavaScript code and locating it in the associated folded. As we move forward towards the last couple of milestones. All of the members of the team have had a chance to sit at one of the four roles in the project. I have notices that the work overlaps a lot and we are constaly helping eachother out without even realizing it. 

### Ensure test quality

The number one tool that has helped us out through out the project and through out all of the milestone to make sure that the work we are doing is substantial and robust is Test Driven Development.
To ensure that Test Driven Development is working the way that is supposed to. We make sure that whoever is at Test seat for each milestones does extensive test with the new code that is bring written and to also inlcude new tests as we add new code into the application.

### Measure all remaining work
We are comming down to the last two milestone of semester. Something that I've shared with my team is that we want to be done with the project by Milestone #6. That way we can use Milestone #7 as a safety net so we can work through the last couple of bugs etc. With that being said, that last main piece of work that we need to complete is the PayPal implementation. That way actual customers can buy products from our website using real money. If we were presenting this to a real customer, during the last two before the project deadline we would want to start preparing our presentation to showcase all of the work that we have done.
