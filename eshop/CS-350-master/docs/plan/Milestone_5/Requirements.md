# Requirements

The project's main obsticles have been tackled and now there are only a handful of legitamate deliverables to finish up. 

### Burndown Graph
Burndown graph can be found [here](https://github.com/Eshop-project/CS-350/blob/master/docs/plan/Milestone_5/Untitled.png).

### Product Backlog
The backlog consists of a list of current work that needs to be done. This can be shown in a table format:

|Product Backlog|Priority|
|---------------|--------|
|PayPal implementation|1|
|Legitimate IDEA surrounding web project|2|
|View for specific product, general view|3|
|View for user account information, general view|4|
|Color schema for web project|5|

These listed features are the most important and what follows will be possible bugs that come with implementing these features. The paypal is the biggest obsticle and after it is set up, and actually works, we should be able to move on to making the website look and feel like it belongs to a well paid corporation. 

The Idea is important because we have no substance to the products or purpose of the website. This may be the easiest, in actual work being done, but it will be the most challenging due to the fact that we have yet to come up with an idea.

The views are for more information on the website. A user account, so the user can update their information and possibly to draw info from said user, such as credit cards and shipping addresses. This will also be for non-data driven views, such as an About us page. These views would be valued as not important at the time, considering we don't know the idea yet.

The color schema is at the bottom of the totem pole with nothing actually mattering except the look and feel of the website. This will also be an important feature, but won't be a huge deal until we get closer to the end.

### Possible adjustment of Project Scope

From the original Requirements and idea of the web page, we have changed a huge amount of detail. From the previous one, we don't plan on anything being taken out, and we plan to finish everything listed above in the current requirements, and possibly have time to continue adding a handful of non-important details to the website before the semester finishes.
