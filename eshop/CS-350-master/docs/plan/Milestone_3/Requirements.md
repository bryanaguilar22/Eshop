 ## Issues for Missing Requirements
 ###  Begin using issue tracking for managing work

 - Need to focus on customer checkout
 - Think about distinguishing difference between guest and customer

## Product Backlog

- The shoplocal app is up and running on pythonanywhere

### Create either an issue or a document to hold the product backlog

### Clearly define the features that you will deliver in Milestone 3
- Use a design pattern
- Data model views pattern solutions
- Build views for all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
### Focus on delivering "Core Features" first

## Plan User Stories
### Document 10-20 User Stories
### Story Outline (Name, User Goal, UX & Workflow, Limitations, How Will it be Tested)
- Karl, browse website, problems in code, using hosted app at the url
- Eric, sell goods, problems in database, using hosted app at the url
- Toby, add an item to cart, problems in database algorithm, click add to cart on website
- Ryan, log-in as a specific user, problems in log-in code, practice logging in



## Customer Review
### Meet with customer to gain approval (Product Backlog, Sprint plan, Progress and sign off from Milestone 2, Document notes from the meeting)
- Customer is happy with progress thus far and excited with what we have. They have no worries with where the project is going becuase it looks to be turning out successful. 

## Team communication
All main communication will be done through text, zoom and in person.

## Plan daily meetings
We have been meeting various times throughout the week to fit everyone's busy schedules. There has been an effort to meet in person every other week however this will most likely occur more often as we get closer to the end goal deadline of the project.
- Everyone is on track, getting their individual jobs done
- Communication has been succesfull

## Document Sharing
* Refine the organization of documents
* Build one library or tutorials
* Start simple but pay as you go
