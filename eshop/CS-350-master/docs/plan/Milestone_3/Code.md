### Milestone_3 Sprint

I have no idea what the format of this is supposed to be so I'll explain the sprint that the team preformed for the last week and a half and explain the programming side of what was done.

## Sprint Plan
- We will add html files and css, along with @Bootstrap to make the website look pretty.
- Add models to preform CRUD operations on data base and also to set up objects needed for site functionality; such as Product and Order model.
- Add admin credentials to enable editting of said objects in database with superuser(TO BEGIN TESTING WEB APPLICATION)
- Add JavaScript files to create functionality, such as adding product to cart, which is also intertwined with other models, so this goes with the adding models section above. ^
- Add url updates to build on what was started in Milestone_2 and to enable cart view, order view, and main products view.
- Add views to use the htmls, as listed above.
- Add user registration system
- Implement guest registration system.

- Add views to use the htmls, as listed above.
### Non-Complete
- Add user registration system
- Implement guest registration system.

From the sprint plan, we accomplished most of the work. The custom user models and all the coding behind that works, but is still buggy and needs time before it can be implemented with the rest of the work already finished. The Guest user registration is being built in with the custom user models, so it's also under construction.

As far as the rest of the work, we do have a functional web page, with the exception of not having the user login/signup implemented, but the javascript and some of the html is written to be used along with user functionality. Meaning as of right now to do anything on the website, you need to be logged in as the superuser. All of the current work has been tested with the custom user model, but not enough time has been spent on the guest implementation and also the user system still has a few issues that need to be fixed. 

I will leave the custom user/guest to be implemented in Milestone_4

## Sprint Plan for next milestone
- Finish custom user app
- Get guest implementation finished
- Configure all HTML to be prone to user athentication, so only user see's what they are meant to.

---------- Possible Adds, based on group opinion ---------------------------------------------
- Add search based on database
- Add more javaScript
- Change css to global variables, so we can change complete color scheme based on a couple lines of css.
- Add more views(BASED ON LEGITIMATE IDEA OF WEBPAGE)
