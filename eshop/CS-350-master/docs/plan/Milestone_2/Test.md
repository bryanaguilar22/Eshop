## ShopLocal - Test Infrastructure



### Unit test framework

* In most cases, a unit is also known as a funciton. The input interface is defined by the parameters of said function and the return value is equivalent to the output interface. The whole purpose of this kind of testing is to verify a specific task is perormed reliably in a defined manner.

### System testing framework

* The whole goal for System Testing Framework is the use of software to execute tests and then determine whether the actual outcomes and the predicted outcomes are the same or not.

### Regression testing

* By testing simple commands over and over again, this introduces confidence to the programmer in a sense that the newly applied code has not sprouted bugs throughout the program. These should always be used when new functionality to an application is developed/implememnted in order to ensure solid code.
