## Shop Local - Refactoring and code structure
### Create framework for customer and guest checkout
We have implemented the guest checkout so as of now our website should be functionable from a end user viewpoint.  The next goal is working on user creation and working on which data should be viewed by an actual customer login.

### Draw diagram of code structure
Our code diagram structure can be found [here](https://github.com/Eshop-project/CS-350/blob/master/docs/plan/Milestone_4/django%20diagram.png)

### Design API 
Explanation: An API key or application programming interface key is a code that gets passed in by computer applications. The program or application then calls the API or application programming interface to identify its user, developer or calling program to a website.
