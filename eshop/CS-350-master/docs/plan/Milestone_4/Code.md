## Milestone 4. Functionality Complete
Role: Programmer Bryan Aguilar- Code

### Goal: Write code - core features

#### Implement User Stories
The following are the user stories I worked on this sprint.  The next phase is to integrate paypal api and make a seperate login as well as register user from the admin panel.

As a guest user I would like to purchase items without registering.

As a regestered user I would like to purchase items using my stored information.

As a user I would like to view items in a cart before checkout.

#### Test-driven workflow


After each page and features that we implement the next thing we do is write tests so that we can automatically test code.


#### Implementation Cycle - Test, Fix, Extend, Improve

For this project we have been assembling what we want rough template of how we want things to look hardcoding information.  Then we go back and program in logic.  We are then testing afte each element is done.  We keep build on the basic views and adding more and more functionality to them. 

#### Implement all core features
Core features are about 75% implemented.  We need to complete paypal API for fully functional checkout. We also need a view to register a user and login seperate from the admin panel.  View button needs to show information about items.
