# Requirements Role - Team Coordinator

### Task Kanban 
The purpose of a Kanban board is to help teams organize short- and long-term goals by diving them into sections. The board helps as a visual tracking tool for teams to maximize efficiency and limit miscommunications. We will be using an online Kanban board to keep track of future Milestones from this point forward. During our next group meeting we will be establishing our goals and dividing these goals into more specifics task. We will then assign these task to different members of the team accordingly. The board will help us keep track of our own progress as well as to keep other members of the team accountable on their own work. We will be using Kanban Flow, which is an online and free Kanban service that offers a lot of useful features to track our progress. We will create a shared account that everyone in the team will have access to.
I will include a link to the Kanban Board resource that we are using [here](https://kanbanflow.com/features)

### Prioritize feature request
The implementation of a Kanban Board ties directly into this goal. By using the board, we will be able to identify our goals and break them down into more achievable task. The KanBan Board divides task into 4 groups or Swim lanes as they call it. These are To-Do, Do-Today, In Progress and Done. These swim lanes can be changed to fir your team or organization better but I believe these will work just fine for our project. As we move forward pass the middle of the semester, we want to prioritize on the main features of our application. This will give us time towards the end to work out the remaining bugs and smaller features of the Eshopping App.

### Sprint Planning
The original spring planning from the previous milestone shifted a little bit as we trying to meet our goals. I am going to address these goals and then I will be delivering what we are aiming to achieve in this upcoming milestone. We wanted to implement user accounts for this previous milestone, but we ended up running into some bugs that required a more time to fix than expected. The way that our website is built, only users who are logged in were able to use any of the functionality such as adding things to the cart and then moving to the shopping and payment information template. We have now implemented the functionality of a guest user. This means that people donâ€™t necessarily need to have an account created with our website to shop around and purchase a product. For this next Sprint our main goals are to implement User Creation, Login and Logout functionality. The reason why a person might want to create an account rather than using the guest check out is that their information will be saved in our database. By having their information saved in the database it should lead to a smother shopping experience next time they come around to purchase a product.

### Burn-down graph
A Burn down chart or graph is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. In order to implement this, we will be using excel to populate tables and then display tables in the forms of a graph. Before developing this graph, I would like our group to start using the Kanban board. By first using the Kanban board we can identify definite task along with estimated time for each of these tasks. A lot of the conversation that we are going to have while we fill up our Kanban Board can be translated into this Burn-Down Graph. We have been spending most of time coding, as we are currently working on implanting the core features of our project. This has made me and group realize that we need to take a step back to analyze exactly we are with the project and write down these task so we can begin using our tools such as the Kanban Board and from this Board we can translate our tasks to a Burn-Down graph.
