E-Shop - Test Plan

Level 1 - Test Plan For E-Shop - Outline the major types of testing that will be done

For the purpose of this class being limited on time and human interaction due to the Corona Virus. We have choosen a basic set of testing procedures for E-Shop, which is our online store. As of right now we choose to ues Manual Acceptance Testing, Quick Testing and Page Tests. Manual acceptance testing will be used when the author of code has to believed to finish a section. A user scenario will be made up to test the functionality of the code. If bugs/issues arise they will be logged in the IssuesLog.md. The Quick Test will be used after basic code has been written to ensure functionality but does not go into much depth just covers what the coder was trying to accomplish. All bugs and or issues will be logged in the IssuesLog.md. The last testing method we choose to use is the page test. After the Quick test but before Manual acceptance testing we will be using Page Testing to ensure all website pages are loading correctly and displaying properly. If they are not issues/bugs will be logged in the IssuesLog.md. These are the methods we have would like to use for our project but may change due to project needs after more code has been written.
