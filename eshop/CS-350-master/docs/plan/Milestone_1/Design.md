# eShop - Technology Selection

Selecting the stack of technology we are going to use is one of the first most important decision that we are going to make as a team. These choices will follow us throughout the lifetime of the project and eventually to the end result. We put a lot of time and effort into deciding what was the best fit for our project. 
## Research of different technologies

As a team we acknowledge that there are several different ways that we can put a functioning website together. We wanted to make sure that we knew our options before deciding what was going to be the best fit for our eShop project. 
We decided to completely disregard the option of potentially buying a existing software since this would take away from the learning experience and the challenges that we are going to face while building this project.

We also considered a content management system such as WordPress but we came to the conclusion that this would have not worked for the idea that we had for our project. Once again it also takes way from building a web application from scratch which is something that we were excited about doing together.

With the other options out of the way we decided to go with a Web Development Framework to build our web application. After looking at the what was out there, we were able to narrow down our options to the following web development frameworks.
*	ASP.net - Microsoft web development
*	Ruby on Rails - Strong developer community
*	Python with Django - Strong developer community, security, popularity
*	Node with React and Mongo DB - Thriving community and very popular

We looked at each of our options carefully and we have made the final decision to go with Python and Django. There are a few reasons why we choose this web development frame work over its competitors. A major reason is due to their high level of security. Since we are going to be dealing sensitive user information such as credit card numbers, we wanted to make sure that we were going to provide high security to our customers. The second reason why we picked Python and Django is because our team members have already had some experience writing python code. This will be one less thing that we have to worry about when we start working on our project. The last key point for choosing this framework was that it would allow us to ask questions to our instruction. Our teacher for the course has over 10 years of experience working with Python and Django websites so in the case that we run into some bugs during development we can always ask questions. 

## Infrastructure – Frameworks and Tools
### Framework
*	Python 3.8.1
*	Django 3.1
*	Virtual Environment

### Web Hosting
*	Python Anywhere

### Development Tools
*	Visual Studio Code 1.48.2
Github
*	Git for version control
*	We will be sharing an account among team members

### Python Anywhere
*	Account: EshopProject
*	Web URL: https://eshopproject.pythonanywhere.com

### Our “Hello World” 
* [Hello World](../master/Hello%20World!.PNG) - This simple app ensures that all of the development 
tools are installed and properly configured.

We decided to pick python anywhere mainly because it allows us to host a web application for no cost. Since we are college students this is a huge for us since we want to save as much money as we can during this project.
