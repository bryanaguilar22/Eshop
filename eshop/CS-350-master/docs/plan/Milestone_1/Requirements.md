# eShop(ShopLocal) - Project Charter

eShop is a software application that runs in the cloud and varying devices. With the pandemic causing small business owners to fall into low times, this platform, with the help of local businesses, will bring those out of the recessions they face. Registered businesses can sell, promote, and discover new ideas to get their products to the clientele they always have. Any user can browse through the specific local businesses and find their favorites and discover new businesses that appeal to them, all in the palm of their hand.

## Business proposition

eShop is defining a new way to shop online for the best of what your local area has to offer! With exclusive deals and quick communication with the local venders in town, this will change the small business world almost as much as the pandemic!

The purpose of this app is to help promote local/small businesses, based on user, and hopefully to become a common placed online shopping market.

### Client

Clientele will be devided into two categories, small businesses and users.

### User Value

The user can browse and support many different small businesses and do so on the go or at home.

### Business Value

The business value comes from the users that supports the small businesses. This is only benefitting any businesses that decide to be apart of the application and keep products and business up-to-date.

### Teaching Value

This project will, hopefully, include best practices that can be conducted when dealing with user/pass collection, database management, payment/refund/user-sensitive-info. If done correctly, the website will hopefully become a legitamate bare-bones example of what an e-commerce website will look like.
